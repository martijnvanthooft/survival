This directory contains the SAS program files, along with the output of SAS runs
at our institution on a particular date, and are the source for SAS phreg
values found in the sas.Rnw vignette.

To reproduce the results you will need to change the temporary
directory in which the files were stored (/bigdata/.... is something
unique to our group), the SAS code.  You also need to modify the
vignette to write .csv files in that location -- look for the 
write.csv commands.

Validation, correction, or other feedback will be welcome.
